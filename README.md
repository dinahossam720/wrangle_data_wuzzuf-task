# Wrangle and Analyze data_wuzzuf-task

in this part we gather,  assessing and clean the data 

Project Overview

Introduction

The dataset that I will be wrangling (and analyzing and visualizing) is the wuzzuf data in 2014 to march 2016 , which contont the jobs that posted and the application that applied on it .

What Software Do I Need?

You need to be able to work in a Jupyter Notebook on your computer. P

The following packages (libraries) need to be installed. You can install these packages via conda or pip.

pandas
NumPy

Project Specifications

Code Functionality and Readability
All project code is contained in a Jupyter Notebook named wrangle_act.ipynb and runs without errors.
The Jupyter Notebook has an intuitive, easy-to-follow logical structure. The code uses comments effectively and is interspersed with Jupyter Notebook Markdown cells. 
The steps of the data wrangling process (i.e. gather, assess, and clean) are clearly identified with comments or Markdown cells, as well.

Gathering Data

Data is successfully gathered:

From the two sources jobs and applications .
the data is imported into a separate pandas DataFrames.

Assessing Data

Two types of assessment are used:
Visual assessment: each piece of gathered data is displayed in the Jupyter Notebook for visual assessment purposes. Once displayed, and  additionally be assessed in an external application (e.g. Excel, text editor).
Programmatic assessment: pandas' functions and/or methods are used to assess the data.
some data quality issues  are detected

Cleaning Data

The define, code, and test steps of the cleaning process are clearly documented.
Copies of the original pieces of data are made prior to cleaning.
All issues identified in the assess phase are successfully cleaned using Python and pandas.
Storing and Acting on Wrangled Data
Save the final to a CSV files.
